# Advent of Code 2025 – Rust Solutions CLI

This repository contains my personal solutions for Advent of Code 2025, implemented in Rust.
The project is organized as a Cargo workspace and includes a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run each day's solution easily.

The CLI provides:

- Simple commands to execute individual days or parts
- Automatic input loading
- A clean and modular structure for organizing solutions
- Rust-native performance with a focus on readability and maintainability

This project is both a learning exercise and a way to sharpen my Rust skills throughout the Advent of Code challenge.

Feel free to explore, run the solutions, or use the structure as inspiration for your own AoC setup!
